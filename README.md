1.Convolution

It is the process using which we convert a given size of the image vector to another reduced form and represent the complete image.In convolution we apply operation from a smaller size of matrix or image vector over the input image vector and try to extract the features .

2.Filters/Kernels

When applying Convolution, the smaller vector which is used to apply convolution over input image is referred to as filters/kernels .

3.Epochs

When training a network from a dataset , the number of times we apply the network on the dataset for training purpose is called epochs. With every epoch the network becomes smarter and accuracy improves .

4.1*1 Convolution

When while applying Convolution we use a filter of size 1*1 over the input image vector then it is termed as 1*1 Convolution .

5.3*3 Convolution

When while applying Convolution we use a filter of size 3*3 over the input image vector then it is termed as 3*3 Convolution .

6.Feature Maps

When we apply a kernel/filter over an input image vector during convolution, then the output image vector which we get is termed as a feature map .

7. Activation Function

It is the function applied during Convolution.During Convolution multiplication of input and weight in filter is done after which activation function is applied which can be sum or maximum value of the output. This is the function which paves the way for output of a layer.

8.Receptive Field

A single cell output of the feature map of a perticular layer is actually formed by applying convolution operation's function over a particular size of the input image , that is referred to as receptive field.
